# Civic
Civic was an open-source project made to 'connect people to politics' through the ability of their phone.
We built this application using React Native for mobile development with Redux Saga for data fetching.

Has recently merged several parts of the application with [BallotReady](ballotready.com)

### Timeline
The timeline for this project was only a few months, and I joined this group around September 2018 until the midterms in November 2018.

### Collaboration
I contributed to building the front-end such as screens for viewing multiple candidates and contributed to code reviews, testing using Jest, helping other new members get up to speed and actively communicating ideas on the features proposed. 

Our team also consisted of other volunteers that worked on the design which me and other developers worked to build, and content managers that clean the data for each candidate needed, as well as marketing managers to help spread the word about our application!

### Challenges
I had used React before I joined this project but for this application the challenge was trying to remember and learning about Redux Saga in time to start helping finish in a few months.

Another challenge was getting the team together at the same time on a call to talk about future features, for help, or feedback on pull requests.
